# Description
This is the code used for my personnal website.</br>
It contains my resume and will contains some of my projects you can find on my git.
I'll add a django app for each project.

The split will be like this : 
- API for the resume's datas, it will be managed using React
- APP for the different projects, it will mainly be static pages

Once done, I'll add the link => [Here, but for now it's google.com](https://www.google.com)

# Tech stack
The tech stack depends on the API or APP, for now the list is :
## Back-end
**Language :** Python</br>
**Framework :** Django</br>
**SQL :** Currently on the SQLlite, but will change for a PostgreSQL
## Front-end
**Languages :** React, CSS, HTML
## Kafka & Spark app

# Design
I'll put some screen of the website once I'm done with the front.

# How to run the project
For the website, you can run it on a django and react local instance.
For the Kafka & Spark, I'll explain once I'm done but the details will be in the readme of the project.
I'll explain in more details once I'm done with each part.
